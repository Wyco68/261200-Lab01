The big yellow sun at the top stands for the warm autumn days.
Under the sun, there are two flowers.
The red and blue one on the left is called the Festival Blossom, showing happiness and life.
The pink flower on the right is the Waso flower, which means new beginnings during the rainy season in Myanmar. 
The green stems and brown ground show how everything grows fresh in July.
This scene together shows the bright and lively feeling of this month.
